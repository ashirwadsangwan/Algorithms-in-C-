### Getting Started with Data
C++ considers data to be the focal point of the problem-solving process. C++ supports the object-oriented programming paradigm. In C++, as well as in any other object-oriented programming language, we define a `class` to be a description of what the data look like (the state) and what the data can do (the behavior). Classes are analogous to abstract data types because a user of a class only sees the state and behavior of a data item. Data items are called objects in the object-oriented paradigm. An object is an instance of a class.

### Built-in Data Types
C++ requires the users specify the specific data type of each variable before it is used. The primary C++ built-in atomic data types are: integer (`int`), floating point (`float`), double precision floating point (`double`), Boolean (`bool`), and character (`char`). There is also a special type which holds a memory location called pointer. C++ also has collection or compound data types, which will be discussed in a future chapter.
